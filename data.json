The audience gets a front-row seat as the film starts with heart touching dialogue between young friends Jumar and Chime through a letter, talking about the brighter and darker side of life that is offered to them separately. The film goes on from a small start of the difficult life of a child (chime) who works hard to find a job -to the ripple effects of unemployment in grown up Chime's life. Scoring some great emotional points, the central character Chime touches the heart of the audience with his natural performance.",
